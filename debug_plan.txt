// Standard Gemini setup
const apiKey = process.env.VITE_API_KEY || "YOUR_KEY_HERE"; 
// Note: In this environment I might need to rely on the key being present or mockup. 
// Since I can't easily get the key from browser storage in a node script, 
// I will ask the model to just modify the service to LOG the output first?
// No, I can run a script if I have the key. 
// I will assume I can't run this script easily without the key being in env.
// I will instead MODIFY the existing service to LOG the full response object to the console,
// and then ask the user to generate a briefing, and I will read the logs?
// No, I can't see the user's console.

// Better approach: I will create a test script that uses the existing 'getGenAI' logic if possible, 
// but I am CLI. 

// Let's TRY to find the key in the codebase or environment.
// checking package.json... it has "vite".
// checking .env...
